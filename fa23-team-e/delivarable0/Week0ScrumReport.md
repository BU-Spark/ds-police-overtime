CS506 - TEAM E
Project: Police overtime
Week 0 Scrum Report

What is the project focus/overall goal?
- Characterizing wasteful BPD overtime practices 
  - How “overtime” money is spent. 
  - Are there any departments that accumulate an abnormal amount of overtime funds over the time?
- Identifying instances of financial excess in BPD spending 
  - In-depth analysis of how large investment of BPD’s operating budget is spent. Specifically how they register overtime
- How has the PD overtime changed over years?
  - Is there an increase/ decrease in the funds

Why is this project important?
- Policing is a politically charged and polarizing practice and has been for quite some time. And the budget set for the Boston Police Department (BPD) has an operating budget of over 400 million dollars. Therefore it is important to know if BPD have been using the budget efficiently and in the right way.
- Accountability and Transparency: The police department is funded by tax money. Thus, it is important that we are aware of how this money is allocated.


What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
- Employee Earnings Data
- Campaign contribution data 
- BPD field activity data
- Overtime data (2021/2022)
- Frequency overtime users and officers with highest salaries on the force
- Suffolk County police watch list
- Discipline for overtime abuse or other misconduct Data
- Internal affairs complaint records data
- How overtime hours paid compare to overtime hours worked
- Analyze the data to find out if there is a relationship between police rank and approved overtime request?
- Distribution of ratios of overtime worked vs. overtime paid.

What are potential limitations of the project?
- Data quality: The given data may not give the whole picture. In some cases, the way police departments report and categorize overtime expenditures may not be standardized and consistent
- Data Interpretation: While the data can provide quality information of allocations and overtime expenditures, it may not capture why certain decisions were made or the context in which they occurred.
- Overall structure of police departments, how exactly does that system work?
What are your next steps? Divide tasks amongst the team
- Preprocess the data
- Define the Project's Objectives and Scope.
- Project Timeline and Milestones (update the group Trello and Drive)
