# Final Project: Police Overtime üöì 

## Policing the Budget: Deciphering Earnings and Overtime Allocation in the Boston Police Department 

- CS506 Final Project, in partnership with BU Spark!

Our project has been made possible with the guidance and instructions from:

- üëâ **Instructor:** Lance Galleti
- üëâ **Spark PM:** Matthew Batacan
- üëâ **TA:** Reshab Chhabra

## üîÜ Project Description

  This research delves into the financial intricacies of the Boston Police Department (BPD), spans year-over-year budget changes, the utilization of injury pay, identification of wasteful overtime practices, and patterns in court appearance overtime. Additionally, we explore the correlation between high salaries and frequent overtime use.

  Extending our investigation, we examine whether BPD's potential understaffing catalyzes excessive overtime spending, considering staffing levels, crime rates, and overtime expenditures across districts and years.

  Our research provides nuanced insights into the interplay between budgeting practices, staffing dynamics, and their impact on public safety outcomes. This can contribute to the ongoing dialogue on policing reform, offering insights for policy-makers and stakeholders committed to fostering a transparent and accountable law enforcement system.
