Detective's attention was initially drawn to the vehicle as it was operating with only the daytime running lights (round headlights illuminated) and no side or rear marking lights. The vehicle appeared to pull into a driveway and the Detective continued on his way. About 10-15 minutes later, the Detective was traveling in the opposite direction and again observed the Jeep, this time parked on Woodard Rd at the carriage lane to West Roxbury Parkway, facing the parkway with just the daytime running lights on. 

Detective Hawkins was aware of a previous Breaking and Entering at 9 Bobolink Street, West Roxbury (reported 01/27/2021 under I# 212005826) in which the suspect arrived and left in a blue/grey Jeep which appeared to be a Patriot model when Detective Hawkins viewed video footage. Jeep Patriots were only made from 2007 to 2017 and have a distinctive body style. 

At the time of this observation, Detective Hawkins was off duty and in a personal vehicle. Detective Hawkins turned to drive past the Jeep on Woodard Road to make note of the plate. At that time the Jeep drove off and made a right onto the carriage lane of West Roxbury Parkway towards Bellevue Hill Road. Detective Hawkins continued on Woodard Road, turned left onto Stratford Road and approached the stop signs at Stratford Road and Bellevue Hill Road simultaneously. Detective Hawkins turned right and continued over Bellevue Hill, turning left onto LaGrange Street. The Jeep was now behind Detective Hawkins and made a right off of LaGrange onto Swan, right onto Pheasant and right onto Bobolink back towards LaGrange. Detective Hawkins turned around on LaGrange to confirm the plate on the Jeep now that it was clear that the operator of the Jeep was familiar with the Bobolink Street area. Detective Hawkins was now behind the Jeep at LaGrange and Washington and took photographs of the Jeep and the plate # with his Department phone. 

The Jeep traveled slowly outbound on Washington Street towards Dedham. Both the Jeep and Detective Hawkins stopped at the red light at Washington Street and West Boundary Road. Detective Hawkins logged onto CJIS from the Department phone and ran the plate at 00:22. the plate was registered to a female at XXXEast Street, Dedham. Detective Hawkins checked CJIS for other licensed drivers at XXXEast St and learned tat aXXX (DOB: XX/XX/XXXXresided there also. Detective Hawkins looked at the CJIS picture for XXXand believed it to be the same person who he had just observed clearly operating the Jeep when both were stopped at the red light. XXXlooked directly at Detective Hawkins and nodded as if to acknowledge that he was being observed. At the time, he was wearing a dark colored top and black gloves with skeleton bone graphics on them. 

This observation and interaction was verbally reported to the primary Detective for the B&E on Bobolink the during the day shift on Friday, 02/19/2021 and is now being documented in an FIO.

This location is in direct view of the runners as it is approximately 25 yards from the race route.

Upon assuming his post prior to the race, Sgt Det Humphreys had observed that the blocking vehicle was not large enough to completely obstruct the street preventing vehicles from traveling onto the security area so he parked his department vehicle in the gap in order to complete the blockade. At approximately 3:10 PM a vehicle which appeared to be an unmarked police vehicle approached the blockade from Montford St and honked its horn at the blocking vehicles in what appeared to be an effort to have them move so it could proceed onto the security area. This vehicle was a dark colored Ford Crown Victoria with heavily tinted windows, equipped with a drivers side spot light and had what appeared to be emergency lights on top of the front bumper by the grill.

Sgt Det Humphreys was alerted by the horn and monitored the vehicle and noted that it did not approach the blocking position and stayed a short distance away and did not come closer. The vehicle honked a second time and Sgt Det Humphreys began to approach the vehicle. As he approached the vehicle moved closer to the blocking vehicle and stopped but did not come all the way to the Sgt DDet who then began to approach the passenger side of the vehicle anticipating the occupant(s) to roll the window down to identify themselves/communicate with the Sgt Det who was in full BPD uniform however the window did not roll down. Sgt Det Humphreys then started to walk around the vehicle to the drivers side to make contact with the operator at which time the passenger side window rolled down.

Sgt Det Humphreys observed a black male operator in civilian clothed and as he scanned the the interior of the vehicle he came to the conclusion that this was not police vehicle and likely not a Boston Police Officer as a result of the operators apparent attempt to avoid contact/identification and by the fact that by order of the Chief of BFS, Superintendent Bailey, all Boston Police personnel are to be in full police uniform for the marathon with the exception of the human intel teams in the area, of which Sgt Det Humphreys was familiar with.

The operator was asked what he was doing, and he indicated ""I have to get through"" and motioned with his hand towards the blocking vehicles. The Sgt Det indicated that the street was blocked and no vehicles were allowed past this point. The operator further indicated that he needed to go in his intended direction of travel and the Sgt Det asked him where he was trying to go and he indicated ""Ruggles"". He was given directions and sent back the way he came.

As the operator left the area, the Sgt Det observed a ""Thin Blue Line"" license plate on the front of the car and observed that the operator was maneuvering his vehicle in such a manner that the Sgt Det came to the conclusion he was trying to prevent him from seeing this rear license plate. The Sgt Det, knowing that Police Officer Trull V740 was positioned further down the street and would be able to get the plate, called him and PO Trull was successful at getting the license plate which was MA Reg XXX
Upon speaking to PO Trull, it became clear that this vehicle had been successful at by-passing two previous vehicle checkpoints in order to get to the point that he was stopped and turned around.

A summary of this encounter was immediately forwarded to BRIC@pd.boston.gov in accordance with SAR reporting guidelines detailed in HLS Bulletin 21-18 issued October 11th, 2021.

The RMV return on XXXcame back to a 2003 Mitsubishi SUV color gray. The vehicle being operated was also a similar gray suv, also 4D. At this time, the officer conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle, believing that the owner/operator had not cleared previously stolen license plates, or perhaps was unaware that the license plates were still listed as stolen. Upon exiting the marked cruiser, in the area of 595 Commonwealth Ave, the officer made contact with an older white male, wearing a light colored ""scally cap"", and black glasses. The male subject immediately opened the door and said the window was broken.

At this time, the officer became suspicious due to the registered owner of the license plates was a younger Hispanic female, and this operator was an older white male. The officer inquired with the operator whose vehicle this is. The operator replied,XXX"". The officer inquired who XXX was, and the operator replied, ""no one I know"". As the officer turned to make a radio call to request an additional unit, the operator slammed the door closed, and fled the stop at a high rate of speed, out-bound on Commonwealth Ave. The officer ran back to the cruiser, however could no longer see the vehicle in sight. The officer notified operations that the vehicle fled, gave a description of the operator and vehicle, as well as a direction of travel. Boston Police Operations broadcasted the information over BAEPERN. 

Following the stop, the officer conducted a search in Mark43 using the last name, XXXAfter looking through records of that last name, the officer located a male subject's booking photo named, (XXX XX/XX/XXXXwho had a very strong resemblance to the operator of the vehicle last night that fled. A subsequent search of Mark43, and CJIS was conducted on XXXrevealing past DCU 94c investigations with this Agency, as well as a lengthy BOP of 97 adult entries. At 1146hrs on 12/31/2021, this officer received an email to his department issued email, from a Middlesex Superior Probation Officer, XXX inquiring into what the cause of the CJIS inquiry of XXX was, and that he XXXhad issued a warrant for XXXtoday (12/31/2021) for non-compliance with his probation. A phone call attempt was made to reach XXXto no avail. 

On Saturday, January 01, 2022, at approx. 0300hrs, Boston Police Operations broadcast over channel 5, asking if any officer was interested in XXXbecause Lexington Police were off with that vehicle in their jurisdiction. The officer contacted Operations and confirmed that this was the officer involved in a failure to stop last night. At this time, the officer contacted Lexington Police dispatch, and advised them of the history of this vehicle/operator/and stolen license plates. Lexington Police advised that they had queried the license plates while the vehicle was parked, unattended at a local motel in Lexington. Lexington dispatch further advised that they had towed the vehicle and removed the plates.
