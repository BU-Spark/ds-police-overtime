OFFICERS ASKED WHY HE WAS NOT WEARING ANY GANG COLORS AND HE STATED THAT THE MS 13 GANG IN EAST BOSTON HAS ABANDONED THE COLOR BLUE BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING STOPPED BY THE POLICE TOO OFTEN. HE STATED THAT THEY WERE WEARING ALL COLORS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO IDENTIFY THEM AS MS 13 MEMBERS.
