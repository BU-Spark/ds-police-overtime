While en-route, Officer Diaz observed a White Hispanic male walking on Quincy St. (odd # side) towards Blue Hill Ave. The juvenile male was wearing a light blue surgical mask, gray hooded sweatshirt underneath a cream color winter jacket, blue jeans, and tan color high top shoes. The Officer inquired over the police radio if the suspect had been wearing a mask while stopping the marked police car to get out and make a threshold inquiry. The B103D (Joseph/Pina) also stopped to assist Officer Diaz. Upon seeing the uniformed police officers approaching him, the juvenile male threw an empty square plastic tray he had been carrying over a chain link fence next to the gas station (310 Blue Hill Ave). Officer Diaz promptly advised the juvenile male that there had been a report of an armed robbery at the convenience store down the street and the suspect description was of a male wearing a ""hoodie"". The juvenile male was further advised that he was being stopped for this reason, as well as he was walking from the immediate direction of the store in question. The juvenile male denied having been in the store. It should be known that the juvenile male was stopped at approximately 87 Quincy St (Between Dacia & Blue Hill Ave) which is about a 1/4 mile from the store (6 min walk per google maps). During a pat frisk for weapons, Officer Diaz discovered the juvenile male had more than a handful of cigarette lighters in his right coat pocket, and a rock the size of a hockey puck in his left coat pocket. Thinking back to the tray the juvenile male had thrown, the cigarette lighters would have fit in the observed empty slots from that tray. No firearm was discovered. The juvenile male verbally identified himself as ""XXX"" and stated he attends the Compass School. While Officer Diaz was writing down XXXinformation, a radio broadcast went out, repeating that there had been reports that the convenience store was robbed at gunpoint. Upon hearing this, XXXbecame very upset and made the following excited utterance; ""Robbery at GUNPOINT? He's LYING!"" This statement was made by XXXwithout any prompting by the Officers and was captured on BWC. Officer Diaz then confronted XXXabout previously stating he wasn't in the store. XXXthen admitted that he had been in the store and further volunteered; ""I only took the lighters because he was accusing me of stealing something else."" The BK01D (Zukowski/Evangelista) and B911 (Sgt. Ramos) then joined the Officers at the subject stop and Officer Diaz went to run XXXinfo.

While Officer Diaz was checking XXXinfo via CJIS, Officer Hypolite (B457D) on scene at the store was provided with months old video footage of the Suspect and per the B911, based on this undisclosed as months old footage, XXXwas released forthwith due to discrepancies in the description. Afterwards, Officer Diaz responded to the store and at this time, the current CCTV footage from today's active incident was now available.

The P901 instructed the officer to catch up to the suspect vehicle and record the license plate. The officer never lost sight of the motor vehicle XXXand caught up to it at a red light at Truman Parkway / Dana Avenue, where he recorded the plate number.

The P901 told the officer that the operator of the suspect vehicle had rolled down her passenger window and sprayed an unknown substance from a spray bottle at the officer's cruiser. The P901 was unsure if she had sprayed any of the runners, and no one had reported any effects from any substances. The officer remembered that when the suspect vehicle passed him, the operator slowed down and yelled something that was unintelligible at the officer before she drove on. Since many motorists and pedestrians often cheer for the recruits, the officer thought nothing of the unknown statement until the P901 alerted him to the operator's actions.



The suspect was a black non-Hispanic female who appeared to be of middle age. She was wearing some sort of light blue or light grey head wrap that could have been a loosefitting cloth hat.
