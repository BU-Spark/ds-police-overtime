Detective's attention was initially drawn to the vehicle as it was operating with only the daytime running lights (round headlights illuminated) and no side or rear marking lights. The vehicle appeared to pull into a driveway and the Detective continued on his way. About 10-15 minutes later, the Detective was traveling in the opposite direction and again observed the Jeep, this time parked on Woodard Rd at the carriage lane to West Roxbury Parkway, facing the parkway with just the daytime running lights on. 

Detective Hawkins was aware of a previous Breaking and Entering at 9 Bobolink Street, West Roxbury (reported 01/27/2021 under I# 212005826) in which the suspect arrived and left in a blue/grey Jeep which appeared to be a Patriot model when Detective Hawkins viewed video footage. Jeep Patriots were only made from 2007 to 2017 and have a distinctive body style. 

At the time of this observation, Detective Hawkins was off duty and in a personal vehicle. Detective Hawkins turned to drive past the Jeep on Woodard Road to make note of the plate. At that time the Jeep drove off and made a right onto the carriage lane of West Roxbury Parkway towards Bellevue Hill Road. Detective Hawkins continued on Woodard Road, turned left onto Stratford Road and approached the stop signs at Stratford Road and Bellevue Hill Road simultaneously. Detective Hawkins turned right and continued over Bellevue Hill, turning left onto LaGrange Street. The Jeep was now behind Detective Hawkins and made a right off of LaGrange onto Swan, right onto Pheasant and right onto Bobolink back towards LaGrange. Detective Hawkins turned around on LaGrange to confirm the plate on the Jeep now that it was clear that the operator of the Jeep was familiar with the Bobolink Street area. Detective Hawkins was now behind the Jeep at LaGrange and Washington and took photographs of the Jeep and the plate # with his Department phone. 

The Jeep traveled slowly outbound on Washington Street towards Dedham. Both the Jeep and Detective Hawkins stopped at the red light at Washington Street and West Boundary Road. Detective Hawkins logged onto CJIS from the Department phone and ran the plate at 00:22. the plate was registered to a female at XXXEast Street, Dedham. Detective Hawkins checked CJIS for other licensed drivers at XXXEast St and learned tat aXXX (DOB: XX/XX/XXXXresided there also. Detective Hawkins looked at the CJIS picture for XXXand believed it to be the same person who he had just observed clearly operating the Jeep when both were stopped at the red light. XXXlooked directly at Detective Hawkins and nodded as if to acknowledge that he was being observed. At the time, he was wearing a dark colored top and black gloves with skeleton bone graphics on them. 

This observation and interaction was verbally reported to the primary Detective for the B&E on Bobolink the during the day shift on Friday, 02/19/2021 and is now being documented in an FIO.

Noting the time of day, and the heavy presence of young, college aged people in the area, and a vehicle with Florida registration, the officer turned the cruiser around to take a second look at this vehicle. The officer was concerned that this operator and vehicle could possible be attempting to impersonate a law enforcement officer, or lure people into stopping.

Once the cruiser was turned around, the vehicle in question abruptly drove down Hinsdale Street and onto the Cummington Mall (privately owned road with public access, by Boston University). Once the officer drove onto the Cummington Mall, the vehicle in question quickly pulled to the side of the road. At this time, the officer placed his marked Boston Police cruiser into park, no emergency lights activated, and initiated a voluntary encounter with the operator of the vehicle. 

The operator, who was identified as XXX XX/XX/XXXXstated that he is a ""five time runaway"", is ""homeless"" and, ""lives in the vehicle"". The officer asked XXXwhy he is in Massachusetts, living in a vehicle with Florida registration, for over thirty days. XXXacknowledged to the officer that he has been in Massachusetts for over thirty days, and sleeps at either the Newton ""rest stop"" or the Lexington ""rest stop"". 

While speaking with XXXthe officer made note of a much younger female seated in the passenger seat. The officer inquired into the identity of the female passenger, to which she identified herself as,XXX, a freshman at Boston University. The officer requested if XXXwould step out of the vehicle so that the officer could ensure that XXXwas voluntarily in the company of XXXand that she was in fact not in danger. While doing so, XXXstated that they have known each other for, ""over a year"". XXXconfirmed her willingness to be in XXXcompany, and stated that they met over a year ago, while XXXwas, ""driving around Pennsylvania and New Jersey"". I inquired if XXXand XXXwere in a dating relationship, to which XXXreplied, ""we are now"". XXXstepped back into the vehicle. 

The officer inquired if any of the emergency equipment was function on the vehicle, to which XXXreplied ""no"". The officer requested that XXXmanipulate a silver toggle switch on the dashboard, to which he complied, and no emergency equipment was activated. 

It should be noted that XXXis 31 years old, and admittedly by XXXhe met XXXover a year ago, which would place her at the time of meeting under the age of 18.

This location is in direct view of the runners as it is approximately 25 yards from the race route.

Upon assuming his post prior to the race, Sgt Det Humphreys had observed that the blocking vehicle was not large enough to completely obstruct the street preventing vehicles from traveling onto the security area so he parked his department vehicle in the gap in order to complete the blockade. At approximately 3:10 PM a vehicle which appeared to be an unmarked police vehicle approached the blockade from Montford St and honked its horn at the blocking vehicles in what appeared to be an effort to have them move so it could proceed onto the security area. This vehicle was a dark colored Ford Crown Victoria with heavily tinted windows, equipped with a drivers side spot light and had what appeared to be emergency lights on top of the front bumper by the grill.

Sgt Det Humphreys was alerted by the horn and monitored the vehicle and noted that it did not approach the blocking position and stayed a short distance away and did not come closer. The vehicle honked a second time and Sgt Det Humphreys began to approach the vehicle. As he approached the vehicle moved closer to the blocking vehicle and stopped but did not come all the way to the Sgt DDet who then began to approach the passenger side of the vehicle anticipating the occupant(s) to roll the window down to identify themselves/communicate with the Sgt Det who was in full BPD uniform however the window did not roll down. Sgt Det Humphreys then started to walk around the vehicle to the drivers side to make contact with the operator at which time the passenger side window rolled down.

Sgt Det Humphreys observed a black male operator in civilian clothed and as he scanned the the interior of the vehicle he came to the conclusion that this was not police vehicle and likely not a Boston Police Officer as a result of the operators apparent attempt to avoid contact/identification and by the fact that by order of the Chief of BFS, Superintendent Bailey, all Boston Police personnel are to be in full police uniform for the marathon with the exception of the human intel teams in the area, of which Sgt Det Humphreys was familiar with.

The operator was asked what he was doing, and he indicated ""I have to get through"" and motioned with his hand towards the blocking vehicles. The Sgt Det indicated that the street was blocked and no vehicles were allowed past this point. The operator further indicated that he needed to go in his intended direction of travel and the Sgt Det asked him where he was trying to go and he indicated ""Ruggles"". He was given directions and sent back the way he came.

As the operator left the area, the Sgt Det observed a ""Thin Blue Line"" license plate on the front of the car and observed that the operator was maneuvering his vehicle in such a manner that the Sgt Det came to the conclusion he was trying to prevent him from seeing this rear license plate. The Sgt Det, knowing that Police Officer Trull V740 was positioned further down the street and would be able to get the plate, called him and PO Trull was successful at getting the license plate which was MA Reg XXX
Upon speaking to PO Trull, it became clear that this vehicle had been successful at by-passing two previous vehicle checkpoints in order to get to the point that he was stopped and turned around.

A summary of this encounter was immediately forwarded to BRIC@pd.boston.gov in accordance with SAR reporting guidelines detailed in HLS Bulletin 21-18 issued October 11th, 2021.
