README with information on how to run the project. 

## Earnings Data and parts contributed by Aaron Zheng (aaronz):

File name is overtime.ipynb
Place the earnings dataset csv from https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report in the same directory as the notebook file, make sure it is named earning-data.csv and simply run the notebook. Install any packages if necessary.

## Field activity data and portions of the content were provided by Chen Yang (Chen):

The file name is Field activity data.ipnyb and the data used is from https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-police-department-fio . Download the dataset for each year and replace the directory in your notebook with the correct year and FIO system.

## Campaign Contribution data and Overtime data by Rithik Bhandary:

We obtain the campaign contribution dataset from https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1JkjM1n8YTbm9SMvJAUJym0qNc8lh1MSE (https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1JkjM1n8YTbm9SMvJAUJym0qNc8lh1MSE) . The Ipynb named “Active_House_Rep-Senator.ipynb” contains trends and patterns of contributions made to the Active House Reps and Active Senstors. The file “Active_CC-Police_CC.ipynb” plots graphs and extracts information about Active CC contributions.

The Overtime dataset can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/mobile/folders/1tXdSNuk_fwmZEYkjptFk3jtDFSHfvXbb?pli=1 (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/mobile/folders/1tXdSNuk_fwmZEYkjptFk3jtDFSHfvXbb?pli=1). The notebook “Year_Details.ipynb” finds the police overpaid hours through the years 2012-2022 and finally finds what does the discrepancy financially amount to, year after year. The notebook “Court_Overtime.ipynb” provides us with insights into how overtime is being used by the Police within the Court, such as year-wise overpaid hours, lin
e chart representing yearly trend, ratios of overtime worked vs. overtime paid and finding potential outliers who have a very high ratio of overtime worked vs. overtime paid.

## Overtime Productivity data and parts contributed by Jakob Rundlett

So the main one to run is “jakobRDeliverable3.ipynb” and it assumes you already have the fio records (fieldcontact table and fieldcontact_name table) and the overtime records from the years 2015-2021 all converted to csv files and titled “2015FioTable.csv”, “2015FioName.csv”, and “2015WorkHours.csv” respectively except for all the years.

Then assuming that, you should just be able to run all the cells
